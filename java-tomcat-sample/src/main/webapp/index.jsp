<h3>Fidget Spinner.....</h3>
<p>
    A fidget spinner is a toy that consists of 
    a ball bearing in the center of a multi-lobed
    (typically two or three) flat structure made
     from metal or plastic designed to spin along its
      axis with pressure. Fidget spinners became trending
       toys in 2017, although similar devices had been 
       invented as early as 1993.
